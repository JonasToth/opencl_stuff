# Goal

I study computer science and try to get an idea of gpgpu programming.
This repository is aimed at that: try it out and see what happens.

Furthermore, this might benefit myself in my bachelorthesis, since i understand things 
better after programming them.

Feel free to get inspired, if you can correct me DO IT.
